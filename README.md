# Rain-Alarming-System
A simple Rain Detection System can be easily built by interfacing an Arduino with Rain Sensor. The sensor will detect any rainfall falling on it and the Arduino board will sense it and can perform required actions. A system like this can be used in many different fields, such as agriculture and automobile fields.
Components Required for this are-
